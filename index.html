        You ever sit with yourself and ask, <strong>“Why am I here?”</strong><br />
        Not just alive, but <em>here</em> — right now, in this world, in this time.<br />
        This isn’t just a website. This is a mirror. A microphone. A mission.

    <h3>Welcome to Where Souls Breathe</h3>
    <p>
      You’ve carried questions no one could answer. A chip on your shoulder no one understood.
      This space isn’t just about purpose. It’s about people. You. Me. All of us — fighting silently,
      searching loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this site, you’ll find stories, divine moments, raw thoughts, and tools to help you hear
      the voice inside that’s been buried under noise. Whether you're lost, searching, building,
      or breaking — there's something here for you.

      <li>Music, books, and questions that stir your spirit</li>
